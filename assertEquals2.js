/*Write an "assertEqual" function once more, from memory. Please DO NOT simply PASTE in from before 
(If you have to go back and look at your previously-implemented code once, that is certainly okay, 
but come back here and write it from memory). Then use your assertion function in a series of test cases to 
thoroughly test the code. Use categorical reasoning to consider all the useful cases. The only automated 
test will be one to ensure that you have created a function that is named assertEqual. 
It is up to you to construct the rest of the "test suite".
The code under test is a function called every. every is an example of a "higher order" function, 
meaning that it takes as a parameter, another function (higher order functions can also return functions as values). T
his function takes two parameters; the first will be an array of scalar values, and the second parameter will be callbackFunction. 
Thus, when you are creating a test suite to verify that every works, you are going to need a function that you will use as an 
argument when you call every. Think about it like this, every is going to iterate over an array of scalar values, and 
apply a function to every value. This function MUST return a boolean value, mainly because we want every to tell us 
whether or not, EVERY value in the array returns true when the callbackFunction is called upon it.
At this point, the general level of difficulty and complexity of the problems will increase. With that in mind, do not be 
disheartened if this takes you some time to figure out solutions. The first step will be to set up some tests for the code, 
then correct the errors in the implementation. If you are truly stumped, please feel free to consult the reference
answers in the last section of the module. Ideally, you should eventually complete the problem on your own.
